## Epic

Youâ€™ve been asked to build a web page that will be used to publish information about different events in Berlin (think  meetup.com). Every event has a date, start & end time, place and list of pre-defined discussion topics.

## Stories

1. As a user, I can browse events.
2. As a user, I can filter events by:
  - city
  - range of start date/times
  - topic of interest
3. As a user, I can save a search filter and re-use it in the future.
4. As a user, I get notified every time a new event is added that matches any of my saved filters. If I am browsing the site at the time, I would like an instant notification, otherwise, it should arrive by email.

## Comments

1. Simplicity and clarity are above all
2. Interpret any uncertainties as you see fit - we can discuss the assumptions you make later
3. Remember about good coding style and best practices, but don't write "textbook" code
4. You can use any front-end as this test is focused on back-end (RoR) skills and we realise not everyone loves front-end :-). React is a plus
